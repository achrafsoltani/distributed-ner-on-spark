# Distributed NER on Spark — Reproducibility Package

Companion code and gold-set data for the paper *Distributed NER on Spark: A Teacher-Student Pipeline for Large-Scale Entity Extraction from Job Postings* (Soltani and Hanine, 2026).

This repository is **not** the paper. It is the minimum needed to reproduce the paper's numerical claims — including the eight student/teacher bootstrap CIs in the student-vs-gold table, the non-distillation B0 baseline, the §4.3.1 error-mode catalogue, the §4.3.2 sliding-window-inference ablation, the §4.3.3 chunked-window-training follow-up, and the §4.5 long-tail latency figure — against the released models, the annotated gold set, and the on-request artefacts documented at the end.

A reproducibility walk on a fresh clone (2026-04-22) verified that all four main scripts PASS or PASS-within-bootstrap-noise; see HEAD `c201656` and the patches that landed in `2bf3455` + `59e2287` + `c201656`.

## Published models

The six student models trained and evaluated in the paper are on HuggingFace Hub:

| Student | Architecture | Teacher | Hub identifier |

## Reproducing the paper's numbers

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu  # CPU torch first
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

# Eight student/teacher bootstrap CIs on the gold set (Hub-aware: downloads ~2 GB of model weights on first run, cached thereafter)
python -m pipeline.scripts.bootstrap_ci

# B0 non-distillation baseline (5-fold CV + bootstrap), top row of the student-vs-gold table
python -m pipeline.scripts.gold_only_baseline

# S2 error-mode catalogue (§4.3.1)
python -m pipeline.scripts.s2_error_analysis

# Long-tail latency scatter (§4.5) — uses the shipped 10K sample by default
python -m pipeline.scripts.longtail_scatter
```

Sliding-window inference ablation (§4.3.2) — runs end-to-end from this package and the Hub-published v1 weights:

```bash
python -m pipeline.scripts.bootstrap_ci_sliding --source hub
```

Chunked-window training (§4.3.3) — script ships in this package; runnable end-to-end against the chunked checkpoints (which are an on-request artefact, see below). Documents the methodology for any reviewer who wants to re-train from teacher labels.

```bash
python -m pipeline.scripts.train_jobbert_chunked --spec pipeline/training/experiments/specs/s4_jobbert_chunked_haiku.yaml
python -m pipeline.scripts.bootstrap_ci_chunked --source local
```

## On-request artefacts

These are not in the repo; contact the authors:

- **Chunked-trained S3$'$ and S4$'$ weights** (412 MB each) — can be regenerated from `train_jobbert_chunked.py` + the curated teacher train/dev parquets (also on request)
- **Curated teacher train/dev parquets** — `pipeline/training/{sonnet,haiku}/{train,dev}.parquet`, the 80/10/10 split outputs of the Phase 5b curator
- **Phase 8 cluster-lifecycle orchestrator** + cloud-init scripts
- **Full raw Phase 8 scaler output parquet** (~647 MB across 43 files) — the `output-sample/scaler-sample-10k.parquet` is a reservoir sample of this
- **Analyst intermediate outputs**

The 1.3M-posting primary corpus is publicly available at [Kaggle — asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024).
